Miscellaneous info/clarifications:
* Types are unchanged from vanilla except where noted.
* Wild pokemon don't hold any items except where noted, and all listed items are 100%.
* Any pokemon that has a stone listed for its evolution method evolves with that stone. If it's any other item, it must level up holding that item.
* Evolutions not listed are unchanged.
* On any route with hordes, the horde encounters are the first three encounters listed (60%, 35%, and 5%).
* Only pokemon available in hordes have been given hidden abilities. The DexNav is not intended to be used, so other hidden abilities should not be obtainable.

* Surfing/fishing encounters are 60%/35%/5%.
