This is a romhack made by Something_Smart for Pokemon Alpha Sapphire. The hack is geared towards nuzlockes, particularly hardcore nuzlockes.
The documentation for the hack can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ0_e71yvNYkNVcxzzJVm9leXN5iAWQHOmNY9B4AW_PB_nSm7c4mpjERwj9g6CMmhIFDUr7fiW13A4N/pubhtml).

Notes about the hack:
* This is not a difficulty hack! It is more difficult than the base game, for sure, but this is not something in the vein of Emerald Kaizo or Vintage White that aims to make the game extremely hard. I don't have a ton of time to devote to nuzlocking, and I do not want to have to spend a large amount of time doing calcs and making meticulous plans for every single fight.
* In the same vein: one of the goals of this hack is to bring calcs needed to a minimum. As such, there are a lot of gimmicky fights, and a lot of enemies that are highly defensive rather than offensive. Some fights are meant to be cheesable some percentage of the time.
* I am a novice at this, and in fact I don't have any tools to edit the ROM directly. So right now I am very limited in what changes I can actually make. This hack only changes: pokemon stats, abilities, evolutions, and movesets; move data; wild encounters; trainer pokemon; and field and shop items.
* Most optional fights are unchanged. I hate dodging optionals. I don't think it adds anything to the nuzlocke experience. The main exception is if the optional fight provides some reward, like guarding an item, or the Winstrates providing the Macho Brace (which does something custom and pretty neat).
* Rare candies are purchasable at the marts from the beginning of the game. If you are playing without level caps, I recommend having a rule against buying them :)
* EV's have been removed. EV training is annoying (even with save editing), and very powerful, and it makes calcs harder where you do have to do them.
* All changed trainers have 31 IV's and the best AI.
* Base stats have been changed. With a few exceptions, all stats were normalized 1/3 of the way toward 500 BST, essentially meaning that lower-BST pokemon got a uniform buff to their stats, and higher-BST pokemon got a uniform nerf. Some pokemon have also gotten custom changes to their base stats.
* Mega evolutions now have the same BST as the base form, but distributed in a custom way.
* Some evolution methods have been changed. Friendship evolutions have been removed and replaced with level evolutions. Some very high level evolution pokemon have had their evolution level reduced (the final level cap for the champion is only 58). Trade and time-based restrictions have also been eliminated.
* Additionally, the Dawn, Dusk, and Shiny Stones serve a special purpose-- these stones are limited in quantity, as opposed to the other evolution stones which are purchasable. They are used to evolve some of the more powerful pokemon. Many pokemon that required a stone or item to evolve have changed what stone/item evolves them.
* Finally, evolving some very strong pokemon-- pseudo-legendaries and other dragon types-- requires you to level up holding a particular held item (such as a Rocky Helmet for Tyranitar, or a Choice Band for Garchomp), which will be consumed upon evolution.
* Some TM's have been changed. See the TM's tab of the documentation. All TM's should be available before the end of the game, without requiring Mirage spots.
* Some moves have also been changed. The Moves tab of the document summarizes the rationale behind the different move changes.
* All moves with more than 15 PP have had their PP reduced to 15. This is to make PP stalling easier.
* I am super open to feedback! You can reach me on Twitch [here](https://twitch.tv/something_smart_) or message me on Discord at Something_Smart#8109. That said-- this hack's target difficulty is relatively low, so if you feel the hack is too easy across the board, you probably aren't the target audience.

To play the hack in Citra: After opening Citra, right-click on Alpha Sapphire and select "Open Mods Location". This should bring up a folder; copy the romfs folder and code.bin file into this folder (if there's anything there already, delete it first). That's it, you should be good to go.

If you wish to play a blind nuzlocke, the level caps are: Roxanne - 14, Brawly - 17, Wattson - 22, Flannery - 28, Norman - 30, Winona - 35, Liza & Tate - 43, Wallace - 49, Elite Four - 56, Champion - 58.
